# ml algorithms test
Tested various ml algorithms on UCI dataset
 The dataset contains 10 different
classes, each depicting one alphabet. The goal was to recognize the best machine learning algorithm in
terms of speed and accuracy.
KNN gave us the best score with compile time of 3 secs and accuracy of 0.993.
